## How to start our application
1) You need to install virtual environment first if you do not have one. But If you already have virtual environment, you need to skip this step
    
       python -m venv venv

2) Activate virtual environment.

       .\venv\Scripts\activate

3) install packages from a requirements.txt file which I already provide it for your guys

       pip install -r requirements.txt
4) start our application by using uvicorn

       uvicorn main:app --reload
